# Palmer Archipelago Penguin Dataset - Species Classification

The **Palmer Archipelago Penguin Dataset** contains biological and ecological data collected from three penguin species inhabiting the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The primary goal is to classify these penguins into their respective species based on the provided features.

## Objective:
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and insights within the dataset.
2. Evaluate the performance of the **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** model using the following metrics:
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
3. Compare the LDA model results with a **Random Forest (RF)** model to determine which approach offers better classification performance.
